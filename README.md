Greetings from Brazil, never found the firmware for this ODE Pico 3DO on internet, so if you are just like me that update your ode and got it corrupted, you can try this firmware I built.
The model is the old one from the photos, I don't know why but you should never press the reset button from the console while using or it will stop working eventually.
When this happened I had to put the cd drive back until the console began to work again and only then change to PicoODE again.
